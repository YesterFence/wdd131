			<h2>WDD 131-1</h2>
			<!-- In the header above, add the name or your site, your name and class number. For example if you are in section 3 you would put WDD 131.03 -->

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			    <p>What makes this website unique is that what website have you heard of that is exclusively cheese? <br>
					Many people would love to just focus on Cheeses and not have other worldly things bombard them for their time of bliss.</p>

			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				The website will talk about how cheese is loved by many people, even those that are lactose intolerant. <br> 
				Itâ€™s dedicated to educating, inspiring, and connecting cheese lovers to one website. 
				This website is the one-stop destination for all things cheese, ranging from cheese varieties, pairing recommendations, cooking tips, and even prices of cheeses.
			</p>

			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will randomly display pictures and prices of cheese when loading a webpage.
			Implementing a button to order range of prices from low to high.
			I'll have a button to ask the user how much of each cheese they would like to purchase. 
			I will use functions to calculate the total prices of cheese and display it.
			Maybe use the same webpage and hide the "recipt" behind the page and when asked to check-out, bring it to the foreground.</p>

			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
